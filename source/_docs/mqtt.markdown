MQTT (aka MQ Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine or "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol on top of TCP/IP. It allows extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm Panel](#alarm-panel)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Camera](#camera)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Device Tracker](#device-tracker)
- [Device Trigger](#device-trigger)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Light](#light)
- [Lock](#lock)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Vacuum](#vacuum)


Your first step to get MQTT and Home Assistant working is to choose a [broker](/docs/mqtt/broker).

The preferred way to setup MQTT for your installation is via **Configuration** >> **Integrations** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations select **MQTT**.

Alternatively, if you want to manually configure MQTT, you will need to add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.

To connect to your [own MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker#run-your-own):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  broker: IP_ADDRESS_BROKER
```

## Additional features

- [Certificate](/docs/mqtt/certificate/)
- [Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)
- [Publish & Dump services](/docs/mqtt/service/)
- [Birth and last will messages](/docs/mqtt/birth_will/)
- [Testing your setup](/docs/mqtt/testing/)
- [Logging](/docs/mqtt/logging/)

## Alarm Panel

The `mqtt` alarm panel platform enables the possibility to control MQTT capable alarm panels. The Alarm icon will change state after receiving a new state from `state_topic`. If these messages are published with *RETAIN* flag, the MQTT alarm panel will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state will be `unknown`.

The integration will accept the following states from your Alarm Panel (in lower case):

- `disarmed`
- `armed_home`
- `armed_away`
- `armed_night`
- `armed_custom_bypass`
- `pending`
- `triggered`
- `arming`
- `disarming`

The integration can control your Alarm Panel by publishing to the `command_topic` when a user interacts with the Home Assistant frontend.

### Configuration

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home/alarm"
    command_topic: "home/alarm/set"

## Binary Sensor

The `mqtt` binary sensor platform uses an MQTT message received to set the binary sensor's state to `on` or `off`.

The state will be updated only after a new message is published on `state_topic` matching `payload_on` or `payload_off`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set,
the binary sensor will receive an instant state update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct state on startup.
Otherwise, the initial state displayed in Home Assistant will be `unknown`.

Stateless devices such as buttons, remote controls etc are better represented by [MQTT device triggers](/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/) than by binary sensors.

### Configuration

The `mqtt` binary sensor platform optionally supports a list of  `availability` topics to receive online and offline messages (birth and LWT messages) from the MQTT device. During normal operation, if the MQTT sensor device goes offline (i.e., publishes `payload_not_available` to an `availability` topic), Home Assistant will display the binary sensor as `unavailable`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the binary sensor will receive an instant update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct availability state of the binary sensor when Home Assistant starts up. If the `retain` flag is not set, Home Assistant will display the binary sensor as `unavailable` when Home Assistant starts up. If no `availability` topic is defined, Home Assistant will consider the MQTT device to be `available` and will display its state.

To use an MQTT binary sensor in your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home-assistant/window/contact"

### Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Full configuration with JSON data

This is an example of a configuration where the state is extracted from a JSON formatted MQTT message.
To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.

To set the state of the binary sensor manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/availability -m "online"
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/contact -m '{"state":"ON"}'
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/contact -m '{"state":"OFF"}'
```

The example below shows a full configuration for a binary sensor:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Window Contact Sensor"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/window/contact"
    payload_on: "ON"
    availability:
      - topic: "home-assistant/window/availability"
        payload_available: "online"
        payload_not_available: "offline"
    qos: 0
    device_class: opening
    value_template: '{{ value_json.state }}'
```

{% endraw %}

#### Toggle the binary sensor each time a message is received on state_topic

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "lab_button/cmnd/POWER"
    value_template: "{%if is_state(entity_id,\"on\")-%}OFF{%-else-%}ON{%-endif%}"
```

{% endraw %}

### Get the state of a device with ESPEasy

Assuming that you have flashed your ESP8266 unit with [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). Under "Config" is a name ("Unit Name:") set for your device (here it's "bathroom"). A configuration for a "Controller" for MQTT with the protocol "OpenHAB MQTT" is present and the entries ("Controller Subscribe:" and "Controller Publish:") are adjusted to match your needs. In this example, the topics are prefixed with "home". Also, add a "Switch Input" in the "Devices" tap with the name "switch" and "button" as value.

As soon as the unit is online, you will get the state of the attached button.

```txt
home/bathroom/status Connected
...
home/bathroom/switch/button 1
```

The configuration will look like the example below:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Bathroom
    state_topic: "home/bathroom/switch/button"
    payload_on: "1"
    payload_off: "0"
```

## Camera

The `mqtt` camera platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as a camera. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated.

This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.

### Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: zanzito/shared_locations/my-device
```

#### Optimistic mode

If a property works in *optimistic mode* (when the corresponding state topic is not set), Home Assistant will assume that any state changes published to the command topics did work and change the internal state of the entity immediately after publishing to the command topic. If it does not work in optimistic mode, the internal state of the entity is only updated when the requested update is confirmed by the device through the state topic.

#### Using Templates

For all `*_state_topic`s, a template can be specified that will be used to render the incoming payloads on these topics. Also, a default template that applies to all state topis can be specified as `value_template`. This can be useful if you received payloads are e.g., in JSON format. Since in JSON, a quoted string (e.g., `"foo"`) is just a string, this can also be used for unquoting.

Say you receive the operation mode `"auto"` via your `mode_state_topic`, but the mode is actually called just `auto`, here's what you could do:

{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Study
    modes:
      - "off"
      - "heat"
      - "auto"
    mode_command_topic: "study/ac/mode/set"
    mode_state_topic: "study/ac/mode/state"
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json }}"
```
{% endraw %}

This will parse the incoming `"auto"` as JSON, resulting in `auto`. Obviously, in this case you could also just set `value_template: {% raw %}"{{ value_json }}"{% endraw %}`.


### Example

A full configuration example looks like the one below.

```yaml
# Full example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Study
    modes:
      - "off"
      - "cool"
      - "fan_only"
    swing_modes:
      - "on"
      - "off"
    fan_modes:
      - "high"
      - "medium"
      - "low"
    power_command_topic: "study/ac/power/set"
    mode_command_topic: "study/ac/mode/set"
    temperature_command_topic: "study/ac/temperature/set"
    fan_mode_command_topic: "study/ac/fan/set"
    swing_mode_command_topic: "study/ac/swing/set"
    precision: 1.0
```

## Cover

The `mqtt` cover platform allows you to control an MQTT cover (such as blinds, a rollershutter or a garage door).

### Configuration

The device state (`open`, `opening`, `closed` or `closing`) will be updated only after a new message is published on `state_topic` matching `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed` or `state_closing`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the cover will receive an instant state update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct state on startup. Otherwise, the initial state displayed in Home Assistant will be `unknown`.
`state_topic` can only manage `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed` and `state_closing`. No percentage positions etc.

For this purpose is `position_topic` which can set state of the cover and position.
Default setting are 0 means the device is `closed` and all other intermediate positions means the device is `open`.
`position_topic` is managed by `position_open` and `position_closed`
You can set it up in opposite way as well.
If position topic is defined than state topic is ignored.

If a state topic and position topic are not defined, the cover will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the cover will immediately change state (`open` or `closed`) after every command sent by Home Assistant. If a state topic/position topic is defined, the cover will wait for a message on `state_topic` or `position_topic`.

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if a `state_topic` / `position_topic` is defined. Try to enable it if experiencing incorrect cover operation (Google Assistant gauge may need optimistic mode as it often send request to your Home Assistant immediately after send set_cover_position in which case MQTT could be too slow).

The `mqtt` cover platform optionally supports a list of `availability` topics to receive online and offline messages (birth and LWT messages) from the MQTT cover device. During normal operation, if the MQTT cover device goes offline (i.e., publishes a matching `payload_not_available` to any `availability` topic), Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable". If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the cover will receive an instant update after subscription and Home Assistant will display correct availability state of the cover when Home Assistant starts up. If the `retain` flag is not set, Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable" when Home Assistant starts up.

To use your MQTT cover in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"

### Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this platform.

#### Full configuration state topic without tilt

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover without tilt with state topic only.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    availability:
      - topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "open"
    state_opening: "opening"

    state_closing: "closing"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```

{% endraw %}

#### Full configuration position topic without tilt

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover without tilt with position topic.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position"
    availability:
      - "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    set_position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set_position"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    position_open: 100
    position_closed: 0
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```

{% endraw %}

#### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    availability:
      - topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "open"
    state_opening: "opening"
    state_closed: "closed"
    state_closing: "closing"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
    tilt_command_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt'
    tilt_status_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt-state'
    tilt_status_template: '{{ value_json["PWM"]["PWM1"] }}'
    tilt_min: 0
    tilt_max: 180
    tilt_closed_value: 70
    tilt_opened_value: 180
```

{% endraw %}

To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your cover manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/cover/set -m "CLOSE"
```

## Device Tracker

The `mqtt` device tracker platform allows you to detect presence by monitoring an MQTT topic for new locations. To use this platform, you specify a unique topic for each device.

### Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: 'location/paulus'
      annetherese_n4: 'location/annetherese'
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: List of devices with their topic.
  required: true
  type: list
qos:
  description: The QoS level of the topic.
  required: false
  type: integer
payload_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: 'home'
payload_not_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'not_home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: 'not_home'
source_type:
  description: Attribute of a device tracker that affects state when being used to track a [person](/integrations/person/). Valid options are `gps`, `router`, `bluetooth`, or `bluetooth_le`.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Complete example configuration

```yaml
# Complete configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: 'location/paulus'
      annetherese_n4: 'location/annetherese'
    qos: 1
    payload_home: 'present'
    payload_not_home: 'not present'
    source_type: bluetooth
```

### Usage

Example JSON you can publish to the topic (e.g., via mqtt.publish service):

```json
{
  "topic": "location/paulus",
  "payload": "home"
}
```

## Device Trigger

The `mqtt` device trigger platform uses an MQTT message payload to generate device trigger events.

An MQTT device trigger is a better option than a [binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt/) for buttons, remote controls etc.

### Configuration

MQTT device triggers are only supported through [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/), manual setup through `configuration.yaml` is not supported.
The discovery topic needs to be: `<discovery_prefix>/device_automation/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config`.

{% configuration %}

## Fan

The `mqtt` fan platform lets you control your MQTT enabled fans.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT fan will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the fan will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the fan will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the fan will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the fan will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced even if a `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it if you are experiencing incorrect fan operation.

To enable MQTT fans in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fan:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "bedroom_fan/on/set"
```

### Default schema

The `mqtt` light platform with default schema lets you control your MQTT enabled lights. It supports setting brightness, color temperature, effects, flashing, on/off, RGB colors, transitions, XY colors and white values.

### Default schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect light operation.

### Default schema - Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### Brightness and RGB support

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office Light RGB"
    state_topic: "office/rgb1/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/rgb1/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/status"
    brightness_command_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/set"
    rgb_state_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/status"
    rgb_command_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/set"
    state_value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    brightness_value_template: "{{ value_json.brightness }}"
    rgb_value_template: "{{ value_json.rgb | join(',') }}"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```
{% endraw %}

#### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (no RGB version) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

#### Brightness without on commands

To enable a light that sends only brightness topics to turn it on, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file. The `command_topic` is only used to send an off command in this case:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    on_command_type: 'brightness'
```

### Default schema - Implementations

- A [basic example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_light) using a NodeMCU board (ESP8266) to control its built-in LED (on/off).
- Another [example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgb_light) to control a RGB LED (on/off, brightness, and colors).
- [Integration guide](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/HomeAssistant) for the ESPUrna firmware (ESP8285/ESP8266).

### JSON schema

The `mqtt` light platform with JSON schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that can receive [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) messages.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing and white values. The messages sent to/from the lights look similar to this, omitting fields when they aren't needed:

```json
{
  "brightness": 255,
  "color_temp": 155,
  "color": {
    "r": 255,
    "g": 180,
    "b": 200,
    "x": 0.406,
    "y": 0.301,
    "h": 344.0,
    "s": 29.412
  },
  "effect": "colorloop",
  "state": "ON",
  "transition": 2,
  "white_value": 150
}
```

### JSON schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

### JSON schema - Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### Brightness and RGB support

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
```

### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (but no color support) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
```

### Brightness Scaled

To enable a light using a brightness scale other than 8bit the `brightness_scale` option may be added to denote the "fully on" value:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    brightness: true
    brightness_scale: 4095
```

Home Assistant will then convert its 8bit value in the message to and from the device:

```json
{
  "brightness": 4095,
  "state": "ON"
}
```

#### HS Color

To use a light with hue+saturation as the color model, set `hs` to `true` in the platform configuration:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_hs_light
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    hs: true
```

Home Assistant expects the hue values to be in the range 0 to 360 and the saturation values to be scaled from 0 to 100. For example, the following is a blue color shade:

```json
{
  "state": "ON",
  "color": {
    "h": 24.0,
    "s": 100.0
  }
}
```

#### Brightness and RGBW support

To enable a light with brightness, RGB support and a separate white channel (RGBW) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgbw1"
    command_topic: "home/rgbw1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    white_value: true
```


### Implementations

- A full example of custom lighting using this platform and an ESP8266 microcontroller can be found [here](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/esp-mqtt-rgb-led). It supports on/off, brightness, transitions, RGB colors, and flashing.

- There is also another implementation forked from the above repository, it supports all the same features but is made for addressable LED strips using FastLED on a NodeMCU V3 it can be found [here](https://github.com/JammyDodger231/nodemcu-mqtt-rgb-led).

- [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting) is another ESP8266 firmware for WS2812 addressable LEDs.

- [MQTT JSON Light](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgbw_light_with_discovery) is another implementation for ESP8266 including [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) implements the JSON schema for MQTT based installs and supports [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [AiLight](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight) is a custom firmware for the Ai-Thinker (and equivalent) RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 onboard and controlled by the MY9291 LED driver. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours, brightness, color temperature, flashing and transitions. Also it includes [MQTT Auto Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)) and the MQTT Last Will and Testament is enabled as well.

- [h801-mqtt-json](https://github.com/starkillerOG/h801-mqtt-json) is a custom firmware for the H801 LED dimmer, a 5 channel (RGBWWCW)  WiFi LED strip controller for 12V LED strips. The firmware is meant to control the 5 channels of the H801 to simultaneously control an RGB and a Warm-white/Cold-white LED strip such as a 5050 RGB LED strip and a 5025 Dual White strip. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours (RGB strip), brightness, color temperature (CW/WW strip) and transitions.

### Template schema

The `mqtt` light platform with template schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that receive commands on a command topic and optionally sends status update on a state topic.
It is format-agnostic so you can use any data format you want (i.e., string, JSON), just configure it with templating.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing, effects and white values.

### Template schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

## Lock

The `mqtt` lock platform lets you control your MQTT enabled locks.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT lock will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the lock will be `false` / unlocked.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the lock will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the lock will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the lock will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect lock operation.

To enable MQTT locks in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/frontdoor/set"
```

### Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this lock.

#### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a MQTT lock.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Frontdoor
    state_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/set"
    payload_lock: "LOCK"
    payload_unlock: "UNLOCK"
    state_locked: "LOCK"
    state_unlocked: "UNLOCK"
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```

{% endraw %}

Keep an eye on retaining messages to keep the state as you don't want to unlock your door by accident when you restart something.

For a check you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your lock manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/frontdoor/set -m "LOCK"
```

## Sensor

This `mqtt` sensor platform uses the MQTT message payload as the sensor value. If messages in this `state_topic` are published with *RETAIN* flag, the sensor will receive an instant update with last known value. Otherwise, the initial state will be undefined.

### Configuration

To use your MQTT sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home/bedroom/temperature"
```

### Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### JSON attributes topic configuration

The example sensor below shows a configuration example which uses a JSON dict: `{"ClientName": <string>, "IP": <string>, "MAC": <string>, "RSSI": <string>, "HostName": <string>, "ConnectedSSID": <string>}` in a separate topic `home/sensor1/attributes` to add extra attributes. It also makes use of the `availability` topic.

Extra attributes will be displayed in the frontend and can also be extracted in [Templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#attributes). For example, to extract the `ClientName` attribute from the sensor below, use a template similar to: {% raw %}`{{ state_attr('sensor.bs_rssi', 'ClientName') }}`{% endraw %}.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "RSSI"
    state_topic: "home/sensor1/infojson"
    unit_of_measurement: 'dBm'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.RSSI }}"
    availability:
      - topic: "home/sensor1/status"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    json_attributes_topic: "home/sensor1/attributes"
```
{% endraw %}

#### JSON attributes template configuration

The example sensor below shows a configuration example which uses a JSON dict: `{"Timer1":{"Arm": <status>, "Time": <time>}, "Timer2":{"Arm": <status>, "Time": <time>}}` on topic `tele/sonoff/sensor` with a template to add `Timer1.Arm` and `Timer1.Time` as extra attributes. To instead only add `Timer1.Arm`as an extra attribute, change `json_attributes_template` to: {% raw %}`"{{ {'Arm': value_json.Timer1} | tojson }}"`{% endraw %}.

Extra attributes will be displayed in the frontend and can also be extracted in [Templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#attributes). For example, to extract the `Arm` attribute from the sensor below, use a template similar to: {% raw %}`{{ state_attr('sensor.timer1', 'Arm') }}`{% endraw %}.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Timer 1"
    state_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.Timer1.Arm }}"
    json_attributes_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    json_attributes_template: "{{ value_json.Timer1 | tojson }}"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Timer 2"
    state_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.Timer2.Arm }}"
    json_attributes_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    json_attributes_template: "{{ value_json.Timer2 | tojson }}"
```
{% endraw %}

The state and the attributes of the sensor by design do not update in a synchronous manner if they share the same MQTT topic. Temporal mismatches between the state and the attribute data may occur if both the state and the attributes are changed simultaneously by the same MQTT message. An automation that triggers on any state change of the sensor will also trigger both on the change of the state or a change of the attributes. Such automations will be triggered twice if both the state and the attributes change. Please use a [MQTT trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#mqtt-trigger) and process the JSON in the automation directly via the {% raw %}`{{ trigger.payload_json }}`{% endraw %} [trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/#mqtt) for automations that must synchronously handle multiple JSON values within the same MQTT message.

#### Owntracks battery level sensor

If you are using the [OwnTracks](/integrations/owntracks) and enable the reporting of the battery level then you can use an MQTT sensor to keep track of your battery. A regular MQTT message from OwnTracks looks like this:

```bash
owntracks/tablet/tablet {"_type":"location","lon":7.21,"t":"u","batt":92,"tst":144995643,"tid":"ta","acc":27,"lat":46.12}
```

Thus the trick is extracting the battery level from the payload.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Battery Tablet"
    state_topic: "owntracks/tablet/tablet"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.batt }}"
```
{% endraw %}

#### Temperature and humidity sensors

If you are using a DHT sensor and a NodeMCU board (esp8266), you can retrieve temperature and humidity with a MQTT sensor. A code example can be found [here](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_sensor_dht22). A regular MQTT message from this example looks like this:

```json
office/sensor1
  {
    "temperature": 23.20,
    "humidity": 43.70
  }
```

Then use this configuration example to extract the data from the payload:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature"
    state_topic: "office/sensor1"
    unit_of_measurement: '°C'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Humidity"
    state_topic: "office/sensor1"
    unit_of_measurement: '%'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
```
{% endraw %}

#### Get sensor value from a device with ESPEasy

Assuming that you have flashed your ESP8266 unit with [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). Under "Config" set a name ("Unit Name:") for your device (here it's "bathroom"). A "Controller" for MQTT with the protocol "OpenHAB MQTT" is present and the entries ("Controller Subscribe:" and "Controller Publish:") are adjusted to match your needs. In this example the topics are prefixed with "home". Please keep in mind that the ESPEasy default topics start with a `/` and only contain the name when writing your entry for the `configuration.yaml` file.

- **Controller Subscribe**: `home/%sysname%/#` (instead of `/%sysname%/#`)
- **Controller Publish**: `home/%sysname%/%tskname%/%valname%` (instead of `/%sysname%/%tskname%/%valname%`)

Also, add a sensor in the "Devices" tap with the name "analog" and "brightness" as value.

As soon as the unit is online, you will get the state of the sensor.

```bash
home/bathroom/status Connected
...
home/bathroom/analog/brightness 290.00
```

The configuration will look like the example below:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness"
    state_topic: "home/bathroom/analog/brightness"
```
{% endraw %}

## Switch

The `mqtt` switch platform lets you control your MQTT enabled switches.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT switch will receive an instant state update after subscription, and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the switch will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the switch will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the switch will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect switch operation.

To enable this switch in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

### Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a switch.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: bedroom_switch
    name: "Bedroom Switch"
    state_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1"
    command_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/set"
    availability:
      - topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/available"
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    state_on: "ON"
    state_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
    qos: 0
    retain: true
```

For a check, you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your switch manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/bedroom/switch1 -m "ON"
```

#### Set the state of a device with ESPEasy

Assuming that you have flashed your ESP8266 unit with [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). Under "Config" is a name ("Unit Name:") set for your device (here it's "bathroom"). A configuration for a "Controller" for MQTT with the protocol "OpenHAB MQTT" is present and the entries ("Controller Subscribe:" and "Controller Publish:") are adjusted to match your needs. In this example, the topics are prefixed with "home". There is no further configuration needed as the [GPIOs](https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/GPIO) can be controlled with MQTT directly.

Manually you can set pin 13 to high with `mosquitto_pub` or another MQTT tool:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/bathroom/gpio/13 -m "1"
```

The configuration will look like the example below:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: bathroom
    state_topic: "home/bathroom/gpio/13"
    command_topic: "home/bathroom/gpio/13"
    payload_on: "1"
    payload_off: "0"
```
{% endraw %}

## Vacuum

The `mqtt` vacuum integration allows you to control your MQTT-enabled vacuum.
There are two possible message schemas - `legacy` and `state`, chosen by setting the `schema` configuration parameter.
New installations should use the `state` schema as `legacy` is deprecated and might be removed someday in the future.
The `state` schema is preferred because the vacuum will then be represented as a `StateVacuumDevice` which is the preferred parent vacuum entity.

This documentation has 3 sections. Configuration for `legacy` vacuum with examples, configuration for `state` vacuum with examples and shared section with examples which are the same for both schemas.

### Configuration

To add your MQTT vacuum to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vacuum:
  - platform: mqtt
```

```
{% endraw %}

#### State MQTT Protocol

The above configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
See also [Shared MQTT Protocol](#shared-mqtt-protocol).

##### State Basic Commands

MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `start` - Start cleaning
- `pause` - Pause cleaning
- `return_to_base` - Return to base/dock
- `stop` - Stop the vacuum.
- `clean_spot` - Initialize a spot cleaning cycle
- `locate` - Locate the vacuum (typically by playing a song)

##### Send Custom Command

Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:

- entity_id
- command
- params - optional

If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:

```json
{
  'command': 'command',
  'param1-key': 'param1-value'
}
```

Service trigger example:

```yaml
- alias: Push command based on sensor
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sensor
    action:
      service: vacuum.send_command
      data:
        entity_id: 'vacuum.vacuum_entity'
        command: 'custom_command'
        params:
          - key: value
```

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

##### Status/Sensor Updates

MQTT topic: `vacuum/state`

MQTT payload:

```json
{
    "battery_level": 61,
    "state": "docked",
    "fan_speed": "off"
}
```

State has to be one of vacuum states supported by Home Assistant:

- cleaning,
- docked,
- paused,
- idle,
- returning,
- error.

### Shared MQTT Protocol

The configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
These services are identical for both - legacy and state vacuum.

#### Set Fan Speed

MQTT topic: `vacuum/set_fan_speed`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `min` - Minimum fan speed
- `medium` - Medium fan speed
- `high` - High fan speed
- `max` - Max fan speed

#### Send Custom Command

Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:

- entity_id
- command
- params - optional

If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:

```json
{
  'command': 'command',
  'param1-key': 'param1-value'
}
```

Service trigger example:

```yaml
- alias: Push command based on sensor
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sensor
    action:
      service: vacuum.send_command
      data:
        entity_id: 'vacuum.vacuum_entity'
        command: 'custom_command'
        params:
          - key: value
```

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

### Usage examples

#### Usage with cloudless Xiaomi vacuums

This integration is supported by the cloud-free Xiaomi Vacuum Webinterface [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo).

#### Retrofitting non-wifi vacuums

- Retrofitting your old Roomba with an ESP8266. [This repository](https://github.com/johnboiles/esp-roomba-mqtt) provides MQTT client firmware.
- If you own a non-wifi Neato, you can refer to [this repository](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/neato-serial) that uses a Raspberry Pi to retrofit an old Neato.
