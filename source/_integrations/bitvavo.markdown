With the Bitvavo integration, you can keep track of cryptocurrencies from the [Bitvavo](https://bitvavo.com) exchange.

## Requirements

Setup requires an API Key and Secret Key from Bitvavo with at least 'Read' permissions. Browse to [API Settings](https://account.bitvavo.com/user/api) to generate your API Key and Secret Key.

<div class='note warning'>

A word of caution: It is highly recommended to use the IP whitelist, and always specify the lowest level of permissions you need ('Read-Only' for this integration). Using an API will bypass 2FA, keep your keys safe!
