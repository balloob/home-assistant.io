The `fmi` integration uses the [FMI](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data) web service as a source for weather data for a given location. This service uses open data license [CC40BY] (https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-licence).

## Configuration

To add FMI to your installation, go to **Configuration** >> **Integrations** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations search for **FMI** and select **Finnish Meteorological Institute**. By default, the values will be taken from the Home Assistant configuration. **Forecast Interval** option can be used to set the weather forecast interval.
