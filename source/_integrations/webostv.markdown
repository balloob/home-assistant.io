The `webostv` platform allows you to control a [LG](https://www.lg.com/) webOS Smart TV.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Media Player](#media-player)
- [Notifications](#notifications)

To begin with enable *LG Connect Apps* feature in *Network* settings of the TV [instructions](https://www.lg.com/uk/support/product-help/CT00008334-1437131798537-others).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

**Notification** section. Follow the instructions and accept the pairing request on your TV.
 This process is IP address-sensitive, in case the IP address of your TV would change in future.

## Options

The options are accessible by clicking the Configure button on integration. 

### Option `Turn on action`

Home Assistant is able to turn on a LG webOS Smart TV if you specify an action, like HDMI-CEC or WakeOnLan.

Common for webOS 3.0 and higher would be to use WakeOnLan feature. To use this feature your TV should be connected to your network via Ethernet rather than Wireless and you should enable *LG Connect Apps* feature in *Network* settings of the TV [instructions](https://www.lg.com/uk/support/product-help/CT00008334-1437131798537-others) (or *Mobile App* in *General* settings for older models) (*may vary by version).

On newer models (2017+), WakeOnLan may need to be enabled in the TV settings by going to Settings > General > Mobile TV On > Turn On Via WiFi [instructions](https://support.quanticapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005985729-How-to-turn-on-my-LG-Smart-TV-using-the-App-WebOS-).

**Notes** :
This usually only works if the TV is connected to the same network. Routing the WakeOnLan packet to a different subnet requires special configuration on your router or may not be possible.

To turn on the TV, create a script in the HA Scripts section and specify its `script name` in the option.

example: `script.wake_on_lan`

#### Sample script 
```yaml
alias: wake_on_lan
sequence:
  - service: wake_on_lan.send_magic_packet
    data:
      broadcast_address: 192.168.1.255
      mac: '01:02:03:04:05:06'
mode: single
```

Any other [actions](/docs/automation/action/) to power on the device can be configured.

### Option `Sources`

Once the WebOS TV is configured and linked.
Turn on your webOS TV and click the Configure button on integration.
Ha interviews the TV for a complete list of available sources currently configured on the TV

If you leave the sources: `empty` configuration, the` media_player` will offer all the sources of the TV. If you listed a subset of sources in the configuration, only they will be displayed.

Note: This is a normal and expected behavior that for a TV disabled only the live TV source is offered in the `media_player`, even if you have also configured other sources. These will appear as soon as the television is lit. 

## Change channel through play_media service

The `play_media` service can be used in a script to switch to the specified TV channel. It selects the best matching channel according to the `media_content_id` parameter:

 1. Channel number *(i.e., '1' or '6')*
 2. Exact channel name *(i.e., 'France 2' or 'CNN')*
 3. Substring in channel name *(i.e., 'BFM' in 'BFM TV')*

```yaml
# Example action entry in script to switch to channel number 1
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.lg_webos_smart_tv
data:
  media_content_id: 1
  media_content_type: "channel"

# Example action entry in script to switch to channel including 'TF1' in its name
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.lg_webos_smart_tv
data:
  media_content_id: "TF1"
  media_content_type: "channel"
```

## Next/Previous buttons

The behavior of the next and previous buttons is different depending on the active source:

- if the source is 'LiveTV' (television): next/previous buttons act as channel up/down
- otherwise: next/previous buttons act as next/previous track

### Sound output

The current sound output of the TV can be found under the state attributes.
To change the sound output, the following service is available:

### Example

```yaml
script:

    sequence:
      - service: webostv.button
        target:
          entity_id:  media_player.lg_webos_smart_tv
        data:
          button: "HOME"

  open_google_command:
    sequence:
      - service: webostv.command
        target:
          entity_id:  media_player.lg_webos_smart_tv
        data:
          command: "system.launcher/open"
          payload:
            target: https://www.google.com
```

## Notifications

The `webostv` notify platform allows you to send notifications to a LG webOS Smart TV.

The icon can be overridden for individual notifications by providing a path to an alternative icon image to use:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Front door motion"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
      to: "on"
    action:
      service: notify.livingroom_tv
      data:
        message: "Movement detected: Front Door"
        data:
          icon: "/home/homeassistant/images/doorbell.png"
```

## Notes

If Home Assistant and your TV are not on the same network, you need to create a firewall rule, which allows a connection on port 3000 with the TCP protocol from Home Assistant to your TV.
