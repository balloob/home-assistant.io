The `HifiBerry` platform allows you to control a [HifiBerry OS](https://www.hifiberry.com/hifiberryos/) media player from Home Assistant. This is an end-to-end streaming lightweight OS built by HifiBerry for their Amp+, DAC+ or Digi+ HAT Raspberry Pi boards compatible with Airplay, Bluetooth, DLNA, LMS/Squeezebox, MPD, Snapcast, Spotify and Roon music services.
