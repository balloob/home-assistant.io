MQTT (aka MQ Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine or "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol on top of TCP/IP. It allows extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

Your first step to get MQTT and Home Assistant working is to choose a [broker](/docs/mqtt/broker).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Manual configuration

Alternatively, if you want to manually configure MQTT, you will need to add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.

To connect to your [own MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker#run-your-own):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  broker: IP_ADDRESS_BROKER
```

Manual configuration is required when connecting to a broker over TLS.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  certificate: "PATH_TO_CA.crt"
  broker: "IP_ADDRESS_BROKER"
  port: 8883
  username: "MQTT_USERNAME"
  password: !secret MQTT_PASSWORD
```

## Additional features

- [Certificate](/docs/mqtt/certificate/)
- [Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)
- [Publish & Dump services](/docs/mqtt/service/)
- [Birth and last will messages](/docs/mqtt/birth_will/)
- [Testing your setup](/docs/mqtt/testing/)
- [Logging](/docs/mqtt/logging/)

## Adding devices
Many devices can be automatically added via [MQTT Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/). 
But If you need to add devices manually, you can go ahead and and add it to your `configuartion.yaml` file.
The following integerations are supported:

- [Switch](#switch)
- [Light](#light)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Alarm Control Panel](#alarm-control-panel)
- [Lock](#lock)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [HVAC](#hvac)
- [Vacuume](#vacuume)
- [Camera](#camera)
- [Device Tracker](#device-tracker)
- [MQTT JSON Tracker](#mqtt-json)
- [Room Presence](#room-presence)
- [Number](#number)

#### Other MQTT Integrations

To connect 2 or more Home Assistant instance togather you can use the [MQTT Eventstream](#mqtt-eventstream) integration. 

To publish Home Assistant state changes you can use the [MQTT Statestream](#mqtt-statestream) integration. 

## Switch
The `mqtt` switch platform lets you control your MQTT enabled switches.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT switch will receive an instant state update after subscription, and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the switch will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the switch will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the switch will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect switch operation.

To enable this switch in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/set"
```

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: bedroom_switch
    name: "Bedroom Switch"
    state_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1"

### Default schema

The `mqtt` light platform with default schema lets you control your MQTT enabled lights. It supports setting brightness, color temperature, effects, on/off, RGB colors, XY colors and white values.

### Default schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect light operation.

Home Assistant internally assumes that a light either has a color or a color temperature.
The state of MQTT lights with default schema and support for both color and color temperature will include a color if `white_value` is 0 or None and a `color_temp` is white_value > 0.

### Default schema - Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### Brightness and RGB support

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office Light RGB"
    state_topic: "office/rgb1/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/rgb1/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/status"
    brightness_command_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/set"
    rgb_state_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/status"
    rgb_command_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/set"
    state_value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    brightness_value_template: "{{ value_json.brightness }}"
    rgb_value_template: "{{ value_json.rgb | join(',') }}"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

{% endraw %}

#### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (no RGB version) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

#### Brightness without on commands

To enable a light that sends only brightness topics to turn it on, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file. The `command_topic` is only used to send an off command in this case:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    on_command_type: 'brightness'
```

### Default schema - Implementations

- A [basic example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_light) using a NodeMCU board (ESP8266) to control its built-in LED (on/off).
- Another [example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgb_light) to control a RGB LED (on/off, brightness, and colors).
- [Integration guide](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/HomeAssistant) for the ESPUrna firmware (ESP8285/ESP8266).

### JSON schema

The `mqtt` light platform with JSON schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that can receive [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) messages.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing and white values. The messages sent to/from the lights look similar to this, omitting fields when they aren't needed. The `color_mode` will not be present in messages sent to the light. It is optional in messages received from the light, but can be used to disambiguate the current mode in the light. In the example below, `color_mode` is set to `rgb` and `color_temp`, `color.c`, `color.w`, color.x`, `color.y`, `color.h`, `color.s` will all be ignored:

```json
{
  "brightness": 255,
  "color_mode": "rgb",
  "color_temp": 155,
  "color": {
    "r": 255,
    "g": 180,
    "b": 200,
    "c": 100,
    "w": 50,
    "x": 0.406,
    "y": 0.301,
    "h": 344.0,
    "s": 29.412
  },
  "effect": "colorloop",
  "state": "ON",
  "transition": 2,
  "white_value": 150
}
```

### JSON schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

### JSON schema - Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### Brightness and RGB support

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
    color_mode: true
    supported_color_modes: ["rgb"]
```

#### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (but no color support) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
    color_mode: true
    supported_color_modes: ["brightness"]
```

#### Brightness Scaled

To enable a light using a brightness scale other than 8bit the `brightness_scale` option may be added to denote the "fully on" value:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    brightness: true
    brightness_scale: 4095
    color_mode: true
    supported_color_modes: ["brightness"]
```

Home Assistant will then convert its 8bit value in the message to and from the device:

```json
{
  "brightness": 4095,
  "state": "ON"
}
```

#### HS Color

To use a light with hue+saturation as the color model, set `supported_color_modes` to `["hs"]` in the platform configuration:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_hs_light
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    color_mode: true
    supported_color_modes: ["hs"]
```

Home Assistant expects the hue values to be in the range 0 to 360 and the saturation values to be scaled from 0 to 100. For example, the following is a blue color shade:

```json
{
  "state": "ON",
  "color_mode": "hs",
  "color": {
    "h": 24.0,
    "s": 100.0
  }
}
```

#### Brightness and RGBW support

To enable a light with brightness, RGB support and a separate white channel (RGBW) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgbw1"
    command_topic: "home/rgbw1/set"
    brightness: true
    color_mode: true
    supported_color_modes: ["rgbw"]
```


### Implementations

- A full example of custom lighting using this platform and an ESP8266 microcontroller can be found [here](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/esp-mqtt-rgb-led). It supports on/off, brightness, transitions, RGB colors, and flashing.

- There is also another implementation forked from the above repository, it supports all the same features but is made for addressable LED strips using FastLED on a NodeMCU V3 it can be found [here](https://github.com/JammyDodger231/nodemcu-mqtt-rgb-led).

- [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting) is another ESP8266 firmware for WS2812 addressable LEDs.

- [MQTT JSON Light](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgbw_light_with_discovery) is another implementation for ESP8266 including [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) implements the JSON schema for MQTT based installs and supports [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [AiLight](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight) is a custom firmware for the Ai-Thinker (and equivalent) RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 onboard and controlled by the MY9291 LED driver. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours, brightness, color temperature, flashing and transitions. Also it includes [MQTT Auto Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)) and the MQTT Last Will and Testament is enabled as well.

- [h801-mqtt-json](https://github.com/starkillerOG/h801-mqtt-json) is a custom firmware for the H801 LED dimmer, a 5 channel (RGBWWCW)  WiFi LED strip controller for 12V LED strips. The firmware is meant to control the 5 channels of the H801 to simultaneously control an RGB and a Warm-white/Cold-white LED strip such as a 5050 RGB LED strip and a 5025 Dual White strip. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours (RGB strip), brightness, color temperature (CW/WW strip) and transitions.

### Template schema

The `mqtt` light platform with template schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that receive commands on a command topic and optionally sends status update on a state topic.
It is format-agnostic so you can use any data format you want (i.e., string, JSON), just configure it with templating.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing, effects and white values.

## Template schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

### Template schema - Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this light.

#### Simple string payload

For a simple string payload with the format `state,brightness,r-g-b` (e.g., `on,255,255-255-255`), add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: template
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    state_topic: "home/rgb1/status"
    command_on_template: "on,{{ brightness|d }},{{ red|d }}-{{ green|d }}-{{ blue|d }}"
    command_off_template: "off"
    state_template: "{{ value.split(',')[0] }}"  # must return `on` or `off`
    brightness_template: "{{ value.split(',')[1] }}"
    red_template: "{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[0] }}"
    green_template: "{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[1] }}"
    blue_template: "{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[2] }}"
```

{% endraw %}

#### JSON payload

For a JSON payload with the format `{"state": "on", "brightness": 255, "color": [255, 255, 255], "effect": "rainbow"}`, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: template
    effect_list:
      - rainbow
      - colorloop
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    state_topic: "home/rgb1/status"
    command_on_template: >
      {"state": "on"
      {%- if brightness is defined -%}
      , "brightness": {{ brightness }}
      {%- endif -%}
      {%- if red is defined and green is defined and blue is defined -%}
      , "color": [{{ red }}, {{ green }}, {{ blue }}]
      {%- endif -%}
      {%- if effect is defined -%}
      , "effect": "{{ effect }}"
      {%- endif -%}
      }
    command_off_template: '{"state": "off"}'
    state_template: '{{ value_json.state }}'
    brightness_template: '{{ value_json.brightness }}'
    red_template: '{{ value_json.color[0] }}'
    green_template: '{{ value_json.color[1] }}'
    blue_template: '{{ value_json.color[2] }}'
    effect_template: '{{ value_json.effect }}'
```

{% endraw %}

#### Template schema - No brightness or color support

If you don't want brightness, color or effect support, just omit the corresponding configuration sections.

## Fan
The `mqtt` fan platform lets you control your MQTT enabled fans.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT fan will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the fan will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the fan will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the fan will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the fan will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced even if a `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it if you are experiencing incorrect fan operation.

To enable MQTT fans in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fan:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "bedroom_fan/on/set"
```

### Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this fan.

#### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a MQTT fan using percentage and preset modes.
There are 10 speeds within the speed range, so  `percentage_step` = 100 / 10 steps = 10.0 %.

```yaml
# Example using percentage based speeds with preset modes configuration.yaml
fan:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Bedroom Fan"
    state_topic: "bedroom_fan/on/state"
    command_topic: "bedroom_fan/on/set"
    oscillation_state_topic: "bedroom_fan/oscillation/state"
    oscillation_command_topic: "bedroom_fan/oscillation/set"
    percentage_state_topic: "bedroom_fan/speed/percentage_state"
    percentage_command_topic: "bedroom_fan/speed/percentage"
    preset_mode_state_topic: "bedroom_fan/preset/preset_mode_state"
    preset_mode_command_topic: "bedroom_fan/preset/preset_mode"
    preset_modes:
       -  "auto"
       -  "smart"
       -  "whoosh"
       -  "eco"
       -  "breeze"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "true"
    payload_off: "false"
    payload_oscillation_on: "true"
    payload_oscillation_off: "false"
    speed_range_min: 1
    speed_range_max: 10
```

{% raw %}

This example demonstrates how to use command templates with JSON output.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml
# Example using command templates

### Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

#### JSON attributes topic configuration

The example sensor below shows a configuration example which uses a JSON dict: `{"ClientName": <string>, "IP": <string>, "MAC": <string>, "RSSI": <string>, "HostName": <string>, "ConnectedSSID": <string>}` in a separate topic `home/sensor1/attributes` to add extra attributes. It also makes use of the `availability` topic.

Extra attributes will be displayed in the frontend and can also be extracted in [Templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#attributes). For example, to extract the `ClientName` attribute from the sensor below, use a template similar to: {% raw %}`{{ state_attr('sensor.bs_rssi', 'ClientName') }}`{% endraw %}.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "RSSI"
    state_topic: "home/sensor1/infojson"
    unit_of_measurement: "dBm"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.RSSI }}"
    availability:
      - topic: "home/sensor1/status"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    json_attributes_topic: "home/sensor1/attributes"
```
{% endraw %}

#### JSON attributes template configuration

The example sensor below shows a configuration example which uses a JSON dict: `{"Timer1":{"Arm": <status>, "Time": <time>}, "Timer2":{"Arm": <status>, "Time": <time>}}` on topic `tele/sonoff/sensor` with a template to add `Timer1.Arm` and `Timer1.Time` as extra attributes. To instead only add `Timer1.Arm`as an extra attribute, change `json_attributes_template` to: {% raw %}`"{{ {'Arm': value_json.Timer1} | tojson }}"`{% endraw %}.

Extra attributes will be displayed in the frontend and can also be extracted in [Templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#attributes). For example, to extract the `Arm` attribute from the sensor below, use a template similar to: {% raw %}`{{ state_attr('sensor.timer1', 'Arm') }}`{% endraw %}.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Timer 1"
    state_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.Timer1.Arm }}"
    json_attributes_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    json_attributes_template: "{{ value_json.Timer1 | tojson }}"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Timer 2"
    state_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.Timer2.Arm }}"
    json_attributes_topic: "tele/sonoff/sensor"
    json_attributes_template: "{{ value_json.Timer2 | tojson }}"
```
{% endraw %}

The state and the attributes of the sensor by design do not update in a synchronous manner if they share the same MQTT topic. Temporal mismatches between the state and the attribute data may occur if both the state and the attributes are changed simultaneously by the same MQTT message. An automation that triggers on any state change of the sensor will also trigger both on the change of the state or a change of the attributes. Such automations will be triggered twice if both the state and the attributes change. Please use a [MQTT trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#mqtt-trigger) and process the JSON in the automation directly via the {% raw %}`{{ trigger.payload_json }}`{% endraw %} [trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/#mqtt) for automations that must synchronously handle multiple JSON values within the same MQTT message.

#### Usage of `entity_id` in the template

The example below shows how a simple filter, that calculates the value by adding 90% of the new value and 10% of the previous value, can be implemented in a template. 

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temp 1"
    state_topic: "sensor/temperature"
    value_template: |-
      {% if states(entity_id) == None %}
        {{ value | round(2) }}
      {% else %}
        {{ value | round(2) * 0.9 + states(entity_id) * 0.1 }}
      {% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Owntracks battery level sensor

If you are using the [OwnTracks](/integrations/owntracks) and enable the reporting of the battery level then you can use an MQTT sensor to keep track of your battery. A regular MQTT message from OwnTracks looks like this:

```bash
owntracks/tablet/tablet {"_type":"location","lon":7.21,"t":"u","batt":92,"tst":144995643,"tid":"ta","acc":27,"lat":46.12}
```

Thus the trick is extracting the battery level from the payload.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Battery Tablet"
    state_topic: "owntracks/tablet/tablet"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.batt }}"
```
{% endraw %}

#### Temperature and humidity sensors

If you are using a DHT sensor and a NodeMCU board (esp8266), you can retrieve temperature and humidity with a MQTT sensor. A code example can be found [here](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_sensor_dht22). A regular MQTT message from this example looks like this:

```json
office/sensor1
  {
    "temperature": 23.20,
    "humidity": 43.70
  }
```

Then use this configuration example to extract the data from the payload:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature"
    state_topic: "office/sensor1"
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Humidity"
    state_topic: "office/sensor1"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
```
{% endraw %}

#### Get sensor value from a device with ESPEasy

Assuming that you have flashed your ESP8266 unit with [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). Under "Config" set a name ("Unit Name:") for your device (here it's "bathroom"). A "Controller" for MQTT with the protocol "OpenHAB MQTT" is present and the entries ("Controller Subscribe:" and "Controller Publish:") are adjusted to match your needs. In this example the topics are prefixed with "home". Please keep in mind that the ESPEasy default topics start with a `/` and only contain the name when writing your entry for the `configuration.yaml` file.

- **Controller Subscribe**: `home/%sysname%/#` (instead of `/%sysname%/#`)
- **Controller Publish**: `home/%sysname%/%tskname%/%valname%` (instead of `/%sysname%/%tskname%/%valname%`)

Also, add a sensor in the "Devices" tap with the name "analog" and "brightness" as value.

As soon as the unit is online, you will get the state of the sensor.

```bash
home/bathroom/status Connected
...
home/bathroom/analog/brightness 290.00
```

The configuration will look like the example below:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness"
    state_topic: "home/bathroom/analog/brightness"
```

## Binary Sensor

The `mqtt` binary sensor platform uses an MQTT message received to set the binary sensor's state to `on` or `off`.

The state will be updated only after a new message is published on `state_topic` matching `payload_on` or `payload_off`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set,
the binary sensor will receive an instant state update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct state on startup.
Otherwise, the initial state displayed in Home Assistant will be `unknown`.

Stateless devices such as buttons, remote controls etc are better represented by [MQTT device triggers](/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/) than by binary sensors.

### Configuration

The `mqtt` binary sensor platform optionally supports a list of  `availability` topics to receive online and offline messages (birth and LWT messages) from the MQTT device. During normal operation, if the MQTT sensor device goes offline (i.e., publishes `payload_not_available` to an `availability` topic), Home Assistant will display the binary sensor as `unavailable`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the binary sensor will receive an instant update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct availability state of the binary sensor when Home Assistant starts up. If the `retain` flag is not set, Home Assistant will display the binary sensor as `unavailable` when Home Assistant starts up. If no `availability` topic is defined, Home Assistant will consider the MQTT device to be `available` and will display its state.

To use an MQTT binary sensor in your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home-assistant/window/contact"

### Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Full configuration with JSON data

This is an example of a configuration where the state is extracted from a JSON formatted MQTT message.
To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.

To set the state of the binary sensor manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/availability -m "online"
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/contact -m '{"state":"ON"}'
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/window/contact -m '{"state":"OFF"}'
```

The example below shows a full configuration for a binary sensor:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Window Contact Sensor"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/window/contact"
    payload_on: "ON"
    availability:
      - topic: "home-assistant/window/availability"
        payload_available: "online"
        payload_not_available: "offline"
    qos: 0
    device_class: opening
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
```

{% endraw %}

#### Toggle the binary sensor each time a message is received on state_topic

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "lab_button/cmnd/POWER"
    value_template: "{%if is_state(entity_id,\"on\")-%}OFF{%-else-%}ON{%-endif%}"
```

{% endraw %}

#### Get the state of a device with ESPEasy

Assuming that you have flashed your ESP8266 unit with [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy). Under "Config" is a name ("Unit Name:") set for your device (here it's "bathroom"). A configuration for a "Controller" for MQTT with the protocol "OpenHAB MQTT" is present and the entries ("Controller Subscribe:" and "Controller Publish:") are adjusted to match your needs. In this example, the topics are prefixed with "home". Also, add a "Switch Input" in the "Devices" tap with the name "switch" and "button" as value.

As soon as the unit is online, you will get the state of the attached button.

```txt
home/bathroom/status Connected
...
home/bathroom/switch/button 1
```

The configuration will look like the example below:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Bathroom
    state_topic: "home/bathroom/switch/button"
    payload_on: "1"
    payload_off: "0"
```

## Alarm Control Panel

The `mqtt` alarm panel platform enables the possibility to control MQTT capable alarm panels. The Alarm icon will change state after receiving a new state from `state_topic`. If these messages are published with *RETAIN* flag, the MQTT alarm panel will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state will be `unknown`.

The integration will accept the following states from your Alarm Panel (in lower case):

- `disarmed`
- `armed_home`
- `armed_away`
- `armed_night`
- `armed_custom_bypass`
- `pending`
- `triggered`
- `arming`
- `disarming`

The integration can control your Alarm Panel by publishing to the `command_topic` when a user interacts with the Home Assistant frontend.

### Configuration

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home/alarm"
    command_topic: "home/alarm/set"
```

## Lock

The `mqtt` lock platform lets you control your MQTT enabled locks.

### Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT lock will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the lock will be `false` / unlocked.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the lock will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the lock will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the lock will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect lock operation.

To enable MQTT locks in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/frontdoor/set"
```

Make sure that your topics match exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

</div>

### Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this lock.

#### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a MQTT lock.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Frontdoor
    state_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/set"
    payload_lock: "LOCK"
    payload_unlock: "UNLOCK"
    state_locked: "LOCK"
    state_unlocked: "UNLOCK"
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true
    value_template: "{{ value.x }}"
```

{% endraw %}

Keep an eye on retaining messages to keep the state as you don't want to unlock your door by accident when you restart something.

For a check you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your lock manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/frontdoor/set -m "LOCK"
```

## Cover

The `mqtt` cover platform allows you to control an MQTT cover (such as blinds, a roller shutter or a garage door).

### Configuration

A cover entity can be in states (`open`, `opening`, `closed` or `closing`).

If a `state_topic` is configured, the entity's state will be updated only after an MQTT message is received on `state_topic` matching `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed` or `state_closing`. For covers that only report 3 states (`opening`, `closing`, `stopped`), a `state_stopped` state can be configured to indicate that the device is not moving. When this payload is received on the `state_topic`, and a `position_topic` is not configured, the cover will be set to state `closed` if its state was `closing` and to state `open` otherwise. If a `position_topic` is set, the cover's position will be used to set the state to either `open` or `closed` state.

If the cover reports its position, a `position_topic` can be configured for receiving the position. If no `state_topic` is configured, the cover's state will be set to either `open` or `closed` when a position is received.

If the cover reports its tilt position, a `tilt_status_topic` can be configured for receiving the tilt position.
If position topic and state topic are both defined, the device state (`open`, `opening`, `closed` or `closing`) will be set by the state topic and the cover position will be set by the position topic.

If neither a state topic nor a position topic are defined, the cover will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the cover will immediately change state (`open` or `closed`) after every command sent by Home Assistant. If a state topic/position topic is defined, the cover will wait for a message on `state_topic` or `position_topic`.

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if a `state_topic` / `position_topic` is defined. Try to enable it if experiencing incorrect cover operation (Google Assistant gauge may need optimistic mode as it often send request to your Home Assistant immediately after send set_cover_position in which case MQTT could be too slow).

The `mqtt` cover platform optionally supports a list of `availability` topics to receive online and offline messages (birth and LWT messages) from the MQTT cover device. During normal operation, if the MQTT cover device goes offline (i.e., publishes a matching `payload_not_available` to any `availability` topic), Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable". If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the cover will receive an instant update after subscription and Home Assistant will display correct availability state of the cover when Home Assistant starts up. If the `retain` flag is not set, Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable" when Home Assistant starts up.

To use your MQTT cover in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"

<div class="note">

MQTT cover expects position and tilt values to be in range of 0 to 100, where 0 indicates closed position and 100 indicates fully open position.
If position `min` or `max` are set to a different range (e.g. 40 to 140), when sending command to the device the range will be adjusted to the device range (position 0 will send a value of 40 to device) and when position payload is received from the device it will be adjusted back to the 0 to 100 range (device value of 40 will report cover position 0).
`min` and `max` can also be used to reverse the direction of the device, if `min` is set to 100 and `max` is set to `0` device operation will be inverted (e.g. when setting position to 40, a value of 60 will be sent to device).

</div>

### Examples

#### Full configuration for position, state and tilt

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover with position, state & tilt.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position"

    tilt_min: 0
    tilt_max: 180
    tilt_closed_value: 70
    tilt_opened_value: 180
```

{% endraw %}

#### Full configuration using stopped state

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover using stopped state.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position"
    availability:
      - topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_opening: "opening"
    state_closed: "closed"
    state_stopped: "stopped"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: "{{ value.x }}"
    position_template: "{{ value.y }}"
```

{% endraw %}

#### Configuration for disabling cover commands

The example below shows a configuration for a cover that does not have a close command.
Setting `payload_close` empty or to `null` disables the close command and will not show the close button.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    payload_open: "on"
    payload_close: 
    payload_stop: "on"
```

{% endraw %}
The following commands can be disabled: `open`, `close`, `stop` by overriding their payloads: `payload_open`, `payload_close`, `payload_stop`

For auto discovery message the payload needs to be set to `null`, example for cover without close command:
{% raw %}

```json
{
  "cover": [
    {
      "platform": "mqtt",
      "payload_open": "on",
      "payload_close": null,
      "payload_stop": "on"
    }
  ]
}
```

{% endraw %}

#### Full configuration using `entity_id`- variable in the template

The example below shows an example of how to correct the state of the blind depending if it moved up, or down. 

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position"
    set_position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position/set"
    payload_open:  "open"
    payload_close: "close"
    payload_stop:  "stop"
    state_opening: "open"
    state_closing: "close"
    state_stopped: "stop"
    optimistic: false
    position_template: |-
      {% if not state_attr(entity_id, "current_position") %}
        {{ value }}
      {% elif state_attr(entity_id, "current_position") < (value | int) %}
        {{ (value | int + 1) }}
      {% elif state_attr(entity_id, "current_position") > (value | int) %}
        {{ (value | int - 1) }}
      {% else %}
        {{ value }}
      {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

#### Full configuration using advanced templating

The example below shows a full example of how to set up a venetian blind which has a combined position and tilt topic. The blind in the example has moveable slats which tilt with a position change. In the example, it takes the blind 6% of the movement for a full rotation of the slats.

Following variable might be used in `position_template`, `set_position_template`, `tilt_command_template` and `tilt_status_template`, `json_attributes_template` (only `entity_id`).

- `entity_id` - The ID of the entity itself. It can be used to reference its attributes with the help of the [states](/docs/configuration/templating/#states) template function.
- `position_open`
- `position_closed`
- `tilt_min`
- `tilt_max`

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"

    payload_open:  "open"
    payload_close: "close"
    payload_stop:  "stop"
    state_opening: "open"
    state_closing: "close"
    state_stopped: "stop"
    position_open: 100
    position_closed: 0
    tilt_min: 0
    tilt_max: 6
    tilt_opened_value: 3
    tilt_closed_value: 0
    optimistic: false

        }
      {% else %}

#### Testing your configuration

To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your cover manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/cover/set -m "CLOSE"
```

## HVAC

The `mqtt` climate platform lets you control your MQTT enabled HVAC devices.

### Configuration

To enable this climate platform in your installation, first add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: mqtt
```

{% endconfiguration %}

#### Optimistic mode

If a property works in *optimistic mode* (when the corresponding state topic is not set), Home Assistant will assume that any state changes published to the command topics did work and change the internal state of the entity immediately after publishing to the command topic. If it does not work in optimistic mode, the internal state of the entity is only updated when the requested update is confirmed by the device through the state topic.

#### Using Templates

For all `*_state_topic`s, a template can be specified that will be used to render the incoming payloads on these topics. Also, a default template that applies to all state topis can be specified as `value_template`. This can be useful if you received payloads are e.g., in JSON format. Since in JSON, a quoted string (e.g., `"foo"`) is just a string, this can also be used for unquoting.

Say you receive the operation mode `"auto"` via your `mode_state_topic`, but the mode is actually called just `auto`, here's what you could do:

{% raw %}

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Study
    modes:
      - "off"
      - "heat"
      - "auto"
    mode_command_topic: "study/ac/mode/set"
    mode_state_topic: "study/ac/mode/state"
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json }}"
```

{% endraw %}

This will parse the incoming `"auto"` as JSON, resulting in `auto`. Obviously, in this case you could also just set `value_template: {% raw %}"{{ value_json }}"{% endraw %}`.

Similarly for `*_command_topic`s, a template can be specified to render the outgoing payloads on these topics. 

### Example

A full configuration example looks like the one below.

```yaml
# Full example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Study
    modes:
      - "off"
      - "cool"
      - "fan_only"
    swing_modes:
      - "on"
      - "off"
    fan_modes:
      - "high"
      - "medium"
      - "low"
    power_command_topic: "study/ac/power/set"
    mode_command_topic: "study/ac/mode/set"
    temperature_command_topic: "study/ac/temperature/set"
    fan_mode_command_topic: "study/ac/fan/set"
    swing_mode_command_topic: "study/ac/swing/set"
    precision: 1.0
```

## Vacuume

The `mqtt` vacuum integration allows you to control your MQTT-enabled vacuum.
There are two possible message schemas - `legacy` and `state`, chosen by setting the `schema` configuration parameter.
New installations should use the `state` schema as `legacy` is deprecated and might be removed someday in the future.
The `state` schema is preferred because the vacuum will then be represented as a `StateVacuumDevice` which is the preferred parent vacuum entity.

This documentation has 3 sections. Configuration for `legacy` vacuum with examples, configuration for `state` vacuum with examples and shared section with examples which are the same for both schemas.

### Configuration

To add your MQTT vacuum to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vacuum:
  - platform: mqtt
```

### Legacy MQTT Protocol

The above configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
See also [Shared MQTT Protocol](#shared-mqtt-protocol).

#### Legacy Basic Commands

MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `turn_on` - Begin cleaning
- `turn_off` - Turn the Vacuum off

### State configuration example

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vacuum:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Vacuum"
    schema: state
    supported_features:
      - start
      - pause
      - stop
      - return_home
      - battery
      - status
      - locate
      - clean_spot
      - fan_speed
      - send_command
    command_topic: "vacuum/command"
    state_topic: "vacuum/state"
    set_fan_speed_topic: "vacuum/set_fan_speed"
    fan_speed_list:
      - min
      - medium
      - high
      - max
    send_command_topic: "vacuum/send_command"
```

### State MQTT Protocol

The above configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
See also [Shared MQTT Protocol](#shared-mqtt-protocol).

#### State Basic Commands

MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `start` - Start cleaning
- `pause` - Pause cleaning
- `return_to_base` - Return to base/dock
- `stop` - Stop the vacuum.
- `clean_spot` - Initialize a spot cleaning cycle
- `locate` - Locate the vacuum (typically by playing a song)

#### Send Custom Command

Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:

- entity_id
- command
- params - optional

If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:

```json
{
  'command': 'command',
  'param1-key': 'param1-value'
}
```

Service trigger example:

```yaml
- alias: "Push command based on sensor"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sensor
    action:
      service: vacuum.send_command
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
      data:
        command: "custom_command"
        params:
          - key: value
```

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

#### Status/Sensor Updates

MQTT topic: `vacuum/state`

MQTT payload:

```json
{
    "battery_level": 61,
    "state": "docked",
    "fan_speed": "off"
}
```

State has to be one of vacuum states supported by Home Assistant:

- cleaning,
- docked,
- paused,
- idle,
- returning,
- error.

### Shared MQTT Protocol

The configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
These services are identical for both - legacy and state vacuum.

#### Set Fan Speed

MQTT topic: `vacuum/set_fan_speed`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `min` - Minimum fan speed
- `medium` - Medium fan speed
- `high` - High fan speed
- `max` - Max fan speed

### Send Custom Command

Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:

- entity_id
- command
- params - optional

If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:

```json
{
  'command': 'command',
  'param1-key': 'param1-value'
}
```

Service trigger example:

```yaml
- alias: "Push command based on sensor"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sensor
    action:
      service: vacuum.send_command
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
      data:
        command: "custom_command"
        params:
          - key: value
```

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

### Usage examples

#### Usage with cloudless Xiaomi vacuums

This integration is supported by the cloud-free Xiaomi Vacuum Webinterface [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo).

#### Retrofitting non-wifi vacuums

- Retrofitting your old Roomba with an ESP8266. [This repository](https://github.com/johnboiles/esp-roomba-mqtt) provides MQTT client firmware.
- If you own a non-wifi Neato, you can refer to [this repository](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/neato-serial) that uses a Raspberry Pi to retrofit an old Neato.

## Camera

The `mqtt` camera platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as a camera. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated.

This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.

### Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: zanzito/shared_locations/my-device

## Device Tracker

The `mqtt` device tracker platform allows you to define new device_trackers through [manual YAML configuration](#yaml-configuration) in `configuration.yaml` and also to automatically discover device_trackers through a [discovery schema](#discovery-schema) using the MQTT Discovery protocol.

### YAML Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: "location/paulus"
      annetherese_n4: "location/annetherese"
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: List of devices with their topic.
  required: true
  type: list
qos:
  description: The QoS level of the topic.
  required: false
  type: integer
payload_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "home"
payload_not_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'not_home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "not_home"
source_type:
  description: Attribute of a device tracker that affects state when being used to track a [person](/integrations/person/). Valid options are `gps`, `router`, `bluetooth`, or `bluetooth_le`.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Complete YAML example configuration

```yaml
# Complete configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: "location/paulus"
      annetherese_n4: "location/annetherese"
    qos: 1
    payload_home: "present"
    payload_not_home: "not present"
    source_type: bluetooth
```

### YAML Usage

To set the state of the device_tracker then you need to publish a JSON message to the topic (e.g., via mqtt.publish service). As an example, the following JSON message would set the `paulus_oneplus` device_tracker to `home`:

```json
{
  "topic": "location/paulus",
  "payload": "present"
}
```

### Discovery Schema

MQTT device_trackers are also supported through [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/). This is different to the YAML configuration from above. Here, the device_tracker can be created via a discovery topic that follows the following topic name convention: `<discovery_prefix>/device_tracker/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config` and the JSON message content of a specific format as defined below.

### Discovery Example

You can use the discovery protocol to create a new device tracker and set it's state using the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.

To create the device_tracker:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"state_topic": "a4567d663eaf/state", "name": "My Tracker", "payload_home": "home", "payload_not_home": "not_home"}'
```

To set the state of the device tracker to "home":

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'home'
```

## MQTT JSON

The `mqtt_json` device tracker platform allows you to detect presence by monitoring an MQTT topic for new locations. To use this platform, you specify a unique topic for each device.

### Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt_json
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: location/paulus
      annetherese_n4: location/annetherese
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: List of devices with their topic.
  required: true
  type: list
qos:
  description: The QoS level of the topic.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Usage

This platform receives JSON formatted payloads containing GPS information, for example:

```json
{"longitude": 1.0,"gps_accuracy": 60,"latitude": 2.0,"battery_level": 99.9}
```

Where `longitude` is the longitude, `latitude` is the latitude, `gps_accuracy` is the accuracy in meters, `battery_level` is the current battery level of the device sending the update.
`longitude` and `latitude` are required keys, `gps_accuracy` and `battery_level` are optional.

## Room Presence

The `mqtt_room` sensor platform allows you to detect the indoor location of devices using MQTT clients.

### Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt_room
    device_id: 123testid
```

{% configuration %}
device_id:
  description: The device id to track for this sensor.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name of the sensor.
  required: false
  default: Room Sensor

After 5 seconds scanner2 reports device1 with a distance of 2. The old location info is discarded in favor of the new scanner2 information as the timeout has passed."
  required: false
  default: 5
  type: integer
away_timeout:
  description: The time in seconds after which the state should be set to `not_home` if there were no updates. `0` disables the check.
  required: false
  default: 0
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

### Usage

Example JSON that should be published to the room topics:

```json
{
  "id": "123testid",
  "name": "Test Device",
  "distance": 5.678
}
```

#### Setting up clients

This integration works with any software that is sending data in the given format. Each client should post the discovered devices in its own subtopic of the configured topic.
Instead of developing your own application, you can also use any of these already existing clients:

- [**room-assistant**](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant): looks for Bluetooth LE beacons, based on Node.js
- [**Happy Bubbles Presence Server**](https://github.com/happy-bubbles/presence): presence detection server for Happy Bubbles BLE-scanning devices, based on Go
- [**ESP32-MQTT-room**](https://jptrsn.github.io/ESP32-mqtt-room/): runs on an ESP32, and looks for Bluetooth LE devices, based on C++/Arduino
- [**OpenMQTTGateway**](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway): uses ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy to scan BLE Broadcaster like smart watches/bands and much more to get sensor values


## Number

The `mqtt` Number platform allows you to integrate devices that might expose configuration options through MQTT into Home Assistant as a Number. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the number entity will be updated in Home Assisant and vice-versa, keeping the device and Home Assistant in-sync.

### Configuration

To enable MQTT Number in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
number:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: my-device/threshold
```

## MQTT Eventstream

The `mqtt_eventstream` integration connects two Home Assistant instances via MQTT.

### Configuration

To integrate MQTT Eventstream into Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt_eventstream:
  publish_topic: MyServerName
  subscribe_topic: OtherHaServerName
```

{% configuration %}
publish_topic:
  description: Topic for publishing local events.
  required: false
  type: string
subscribe_topic:
  description: Topic to receive events from the remote server.
  required: false
  type: string
ignore_event:
  description: List of [events](/docs/configuration/events/) which will not be sent over mqtt.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

### Multiple Instances

Events from multiple instances can be aggregated to a single master instance by subscribing to a wildcard topic from the master instance.

```yaml
# Example master instance configuration.yaml entry
mqtt_eventstream:
  publish_topic: master/topic
  subscribe_topic: slaves/#
  ignore_event:
    - call_service
    - state_changed
```

For a multiple instance setup, each slave would publish to their own topic.

```yaml
# Example slave instance configuration.yaml entry
mqtt_eventstream:
  publish_topic: slaves/upstairs
  subscribe_topic: master/topic
```

```yaml
# Example slave instance configuration.yaml entry
mqtt_eventstream:
  publish_topic: slaves/downstairs
  subscribe_topic: master/topic
```

## MQTT Statestream

The `mqtt_statestream` integration publishes state changes in Home Assistant to individual MQTT topics.

### Configuration

To enable MQTT Statestream in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt_statestream:
  base_topic: homeassistant
  publish_attributes: true
  publish_timestamps: true
```

{% configuration %}
base_topic:
  description: Base topic used to generate the actual topic used to publish.
  required: true
  type: string
publish_attributes:
  description: Publish attributes of the entity as well as the state.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
publish_timestamps:
  description: Publish the last_changed and last_updated timestamps for the entity.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
exclude:
  description: Configure which integrations should be excluded from recordings. ([Configure Filter](#configure-filter))
  required: false
  type: list
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be excluded from recordings.
      required: false
      type: list
    entity_globs:
      description: Exclude all entities matching a listed pattern from recordings (e.g., `sensor.weather_*`).
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be excluded from recordings.
      required: false
      type: list
include:
  description: Configure which integrations should be included in recordings. If set, all other entities will not be recorded. ([Configure Filter](#configure-filter))
  required: false
  type: list
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be included from recordings.
      required: false
      type: list
    entity_globs:
      description: Include all entities matching a listed pattern in recordings (e.g., `sensor.weather_*`).
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be included from recordings.
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

#### Configure Filter

By default, no entity will be excluded. To limit which entities are being exposed to `MQTT Statestream`, you can use the `include` and `exclude` parameters.

```yaml
# Example filter to include specified domains and exclude specified entities
mqtt_statestream:
  base_topic: homeassistant
  include:
    domains:
      - alarm_control_panel
      - light
    entity_globs:
      - binary_sensor.*_occupancy
  exclude:
    entities:
      - light.kitchen_light
```

Filters are applied as follows:

1. No includes or excludes - pass all entities
2. Includes, no excludes - only include specified entities
3. Excludes, no includes - only exclude specified entities
4. Both includes and excludes:
   - Include domain and/or glob patterns specified
      - If domain is included, and entity not excluded or match exclude glob pattern, pass
      - If entity matches include glob pattern, and entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
      - If domain is not included, glob pattern does not match, and entity not included, fail
   - Exclude domain and/or glob patterns specified and include does not list domains or glob patterns
      - If domain is excluded and entity not included, fail
      - If entity matches exclude glob pattern and entity not included, fail
      - If entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
   - Neither include or exclude specifies domains or glob patterns
      - If entity is included, pass (as #2 above)
      - If entity include and exclude, the entity exclude is ignored

#### Common filtering examples

```yaml
# Example of excluding entities
mqtt_statestream:
  base_topic: homeassistant
  exclude:
    domains:
      - switch
    entities:
      - sensor.nopublish
```

In the above example, all entities except for *switch.x* and *sensor.nopublish* will be published to MQTT.

```yaml
# Example of excluding entities
mqtt_statestream:
  base_topic: homeassistant
  include:
    domains:
      - sensor
    entities:
      - lock.important
```

In this example, only *sensor.x* and *lock.important* will be published.

```yaml
# Example of excluding entities
mqtt_statestream:
  base_topic: homeassistant
  include:
    domains:
      - sensor
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.noshow
```

In this example, all sensors except for *sensor.noshow* will be published.

### Operation

When any Home Assistant entity changes, this integration will publish that change to MQTT.

The topic for each entity is different, so you can easily subscribe other systems to just the entities you are interested in.
The topic will be in the form `base_topic/domain/entity/state`.

For example, with the example configuration above, if an entity called 'light.master_bedroom_dimmer' is turned on, this integration will publish `on` to `homeassistant/light/master_bedroom_dimmer/state`.

If that entity also has an attribute called `brightness`, the integration will also publish the value of that attribute to `homeassistant/light/master_bedroom_dimmer/brightness`.

All states and attributes are passed through JSON serialization before publishing. **Please note** that this causes strings to be quoted (e.g., the string 'on' will be published as '"on"'). You can access the JSON deserialized values (as well as unquoted strings) at many places by using `value_json` instead of `value`.

The last_updated and last_changed values for the entity will be published to `homeassistant/light/master_bedroom_dimmer/last_updated` and `homeassistant/light/master_bedroom_dimmer/last_changed`, respectively. The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format - for example, `2017-10-01T23:20:30.920969+00:00`.
