With the Gandi.net integration you can keep your current IP address in sync with your [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net) registered hostname or domain.

The integration runs at regular intervals, but can also be started manually by using the service `gandi_livedns.update_records` under services.

## Requirements

<div class='note'>
Note that it does not create the initial DNS record but only updates it; you will still have to do this manually.
</div>

Setup requires a unique Gandi API Key. If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can generate your production API key from the API Key Page in the Security section.

[Gandi.net account page](https://account.gandi.net/fr).
